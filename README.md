## Inctruction

1. Install Pyro and Python (version grater than or equal to 3.6) 
2. Download SUMO [click here!](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing.html) (linux preferably)
3. Download all of the "Factor" files into one directory "/sumo/tools" without any subdirectories (the easiest way to do this is to click the "Clone or Download" button)
4. Move "vtype_gen.py" and "factors.json" from "/hse-1c_human-factor/code" to the "/tools" directory
5. Replace "randomTrips.py" from "/tools" with "randomTrips.py" from "/code"
6. Set your desired values in "factors.json":
- Age: from 17 to 100
- Sex: 0 for men, 1 for women
- Stress: float (0-1)
- Children: bool (1 for yes)
- Personality: phlegmatic, holeric, sanguine, melancholic
- Phone: bool (1 for yes)
- Higher Education: bool (1 for yes)
- Driving under influence: float (0-1)
- Social Deviance: degree (0-weak impact, 1- average impact, 2-strong impact)
- Foreigner: bool (1 for yes)
7. Run the simulation (run the command "python3 osmWebWizard.py")
